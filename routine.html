        <h1>How will I achieve these goals?</h1>
        <p>Now that I am graduating, I have been forced to come to the realization that I need to turn this hobby into applicable skills and resume items that will help me land a job. This means that I have to stop watching as much YouTube on the subject and do more projects and certifications. Currently this means my routine consists of a 9am wakeup, study for certs for half an hour, get ready for class, return from class and eat lunch, more certs until next class, then homework the rest of the day.</p>
