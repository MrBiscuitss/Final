        <h1>Cybersecurity & Networking</h1>
        <p>Before starting my degree, I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to pursue. One path that jumped out to me was cybersecurity just because I thought that it looked cool. In my junior year, I took a class called MI 361. This class deepened my passion for cybersecurity while showing me another path that was networking. I am currently pursuing certifications for both of these sectors of IT and I hope to do more in the future. Within a few years I hope to become a network engineer in whatever city life takes me to.</p>
